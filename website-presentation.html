      <div class='presentation-text'>
        <p>For the last 4 years, I have been working as a software tester. I did not do a lot of UI testing,
        but recently, I discovered a cool trick we can use if we want to test our shiny new websites.</p>
        <p>The problem with the testing of a website is often that you do not have a bunch of different devices
          with different operating systems and browsers laying around to check if your website is nicely displayed
           on all of them. Well do not worry longer, because all that can easily be similated!</p>
        <p>In InternetingIsHard, we already learned we can adjust the number of pixels displayed in our browser
          in order to imitate the size of another device, by clicking the following icon in the developer tools:</p>
        <img src='change-pixels.png' class='presentation-image' width='550' />
        <p>However, we can also imitate another operating system! By downloading the "User-Agent switcher"
          -extension, you can quickly switch between user-agent strings. You can change the user-agent like this:</p>
        <img src='user-agent-switcher.png' class='presentation-image' width ='550'/>
        <p>The combination of the last 2 options lets you thorougly test your new website, making sure it will
          show nicely on all devices and on different platforms.</p>
